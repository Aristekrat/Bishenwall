1 - Make one last heroic attempt to get Angular to auto-update on reply. The workaround is not ideal. 
2 - Intelligently handle it when the user clicks save on the application:
        .rework postComment so that it works in the same mostly angular way as the reply
        .notify the user in some way that they've posted successfully
3 - Refactor the submit / save comment functions to eliminate the code-uglifying redundancy.
4 - Deploy a minified version of the Bishenwall that minifies before hitting heroku
        .STATUS: Heroku is ignoring the post-install command. Stopping for now. 12/16/13.
5 - Add sessions based on the IP
        .create the node sessions based on IP
        .re-create the old session if a user clears cache
        .change text and disable button on click
        .figure out a way to leave the button in a changed state after page refresh for the reported comment
        .$inc the spam counter for the repoted comment
6 - Write the Report Spam function that incs the spam count with each press
7 - Increase Jasmine / Karma test coverage
8 - Figure out live reload with Grunt's watch function. Currently it would only be useful for CSS changes, but I still want it.
9 - Lint everything.
10 - Stop Heroku from sleeping.
