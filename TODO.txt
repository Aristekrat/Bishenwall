1 - Create the html partials
2 - Add IP checking and spam report functionality in node
3 - Integrate Jasmine and Karma
4 - Add dummy comments once you can properly hide / call the comment form
5 - Figure out live reload with Grunt's watch function. Currently it would only be useful for CSS changes, but I still want it. 
6 - Add front-end validation to the comment form
7 - Spawn a full minified and compressed version of BW through Grunt
