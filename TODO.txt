        .notify the user in some way that they've posted successfully
3 - Add the IP to all comments

        .STATUS: Heroku is ignoring the post-install command. Stopping for now. 12/16/13.
5 - Add sessions based on the IP
6 - Write the Report Spam function that incs the spam count with each press
7 - Increase Jasmine / Karma test coverage
