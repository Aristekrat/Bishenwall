1 - Refactor
        *Change the schema to hold references for replies rather than docs themselves
        *Move the routes to their own seperate file.
        *Move the schemas to the server side code.
        *Move the utility functions to their own file
2 - Add pagination
3 - Add Image upload possibility.
        *Proved far less cooperative than I was anticipating. Currently working on getting Angular to properly submit the image to the backend. 
        Unclear if that worked, HTTP req comes through fine but the console logs a blank object.    
4 - Add the custom URL.
5 - Lint everything.
6 - Deploy a minified version of the Bishenwall that minifies before hitting heroku
        .STATUS: Heroku is ignoring the post-install command. Stopping for now. 12/16/13.
7 - Optimize Speed
8 - Deploy Google Analytics
9 - Check the FB link once it's deployed to prod to make sure it's working correctly. 
        *Edit: it's not >.< Possibly because Google is not crawling the site at the moment. Need to rework the meta-data. 
10 - Make everything responsive again.
11 - Do a manual full system test
12 - Increase Jasmine / Karma test coverage
13 - Automagically insert new content in a way that isn't disruptive
